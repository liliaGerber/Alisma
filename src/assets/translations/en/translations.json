    "ronny_introduction": "For over 30 years, Ronny Hollenstein has worked as a trainer and coach with a focus on self-leadership, leadership, and communication. Trained by renowned figures such as Vera F. Birkenbihl, Shirzad Chamine, Maja Storch, and others, he has dedicated his career to helping people find their path and walk it authentically. His clients include leading figures from politics, business, and the public sector.\nOriginally from Vorarlberg and now based in Vienna, he has held several political roles and understands the challenge of conveying complex topics in a simple and clear way.\nSince most outcomes in organizations are achieved through communication, improving it is especially close to Ronny’s heart. Better communication reduces transaction costs caused by misunderstandings, endless repetitions, unproductive debates about the unchangeable, and poorly resolved conflicts.",

      "why": {
        "title": "Why Modern Man?",
        "body": "Because performance without self-regulation is costly. HTLs combine high pressure, project dynamics, and rigid role models. If you can’t read or express feelings, you lose focus, teamwork, and resilience. Modern strength means: understand emotions, respect boundaries, take responsibility—in projects, in class, and later at work."

      "problem": {
        "title": "What’s the problem?",
        "body": "Many boys learn early: be strong, don’t cry, show no weakness. Constantly suppressing emotions leads to depression or uncontrolled aggression. The consequences show up in society: young men are more often prosecuted or die by suicide. The roots lie in early upbringing and role models: girls may cry but should be quiet; boys should assert themselves, take what they want, show dominance. Later comes the pressure to be the “man of the house” and the breadwinner. Equality—e.g., equal pay—gives women appreciation and relieves pressure on men."
