    "ronny_introduction": "Ronny Hollenstein has worked for over 30 years as a trainer and coach focusing on self-leadership, leadership, and communication. Trained by renowned figures such as Vera F. Birkenbihl, Shirzad Chamine, Maja Storch, and others, he has dedicated his career to helping people find their path and follow it authentically. His clients include leaders from top politics, business, and the public sector.\nOriginally from Vorarlberg and now based in Vienna, he has held several political functions and understands the challenge of conveying complex topics simply and clearly.\nSince most results in organizations are achieved through communication, Ronny is especially committed to improving it. Better communication reduces transaction costs caused by misunderstandings, endless repetitions, unproductive debates about the unchangeable, and poorly resolved conflicts.",
